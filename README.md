========================

Example of Observer pattern

This program allow to approximate a shape to draw it, using many points. 

We want to make two changes:

if debugMode is enable.

- Allow to main program to know the percentage of generated points inside the shape. 

- Allow to main program to generate points outside the sphere.

- The DrawShpere and AcceptShape cannot be changed.
